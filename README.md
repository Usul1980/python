## python projects
In this repo i may upload a few python projects ive worked on.
### Covid19
For this particular project i assumed to help an organisation model the factors that contributed to the death rate caused by coronavirus at the level of a country. The code and the resultant independent paper that we published with the model results are to be found in the folder above called Covid19.

### pythonanywhere
### x-ray covid19 detector

For this project i am sharing with you how to productionise a model in the cloud...FREE! All too often it is lamented that data scientists can't productionise their models. This repo aims to help remedy that. Besides that, pythonanywhere is public, so that we also help democratize data science models and other. Build and deploy your own covid19 x-ray detector, all found in the above pythonanywhere.com folder. Please be aware that for all the data required in the notebook, you can navigate to my kaggle book on this same project here for it:

### Coursera - Advanced Machine Learning
This specialization on Coursera sees one doing many ml, deep learning and AI tasks. I am still busy with the first part of the sepcialization, called introduction to deep learning, and have already trianed an mnist model, an image classifier and a flower classifier, all using CNN's. Here is the link to this course:
